.env= 
    will hold all config to your enviroment

config=
    Allconfiguration files are stored there

#"Any variable" in your .env= file "can be overridden" by "external environment variables" such as server-level or system-level environment variables.

'debug' => env('APP_DEBUG', false),
    second parameter is the "default value". can be overwritten

APP_ENV= 
    detection can be overridden by a server-level environment variable. useful when share the same app for different env config, to set up a given host to match a given environment in your server's configs.

debug_blacklist= 
    in "config/app.php" to hide specific variable

Accessing_Configuration_Values=
    config(['app.timezone' => 'America/Chicago']);

#Concept
middleware= 
    kind of Rule/condition

Kernel= 
    Feed it HTTP requests and it will return HTTP responses.

Service_provider= 
    central place of all Laravel application bootstrapping to configure app
    "responsible_for" Bootstrapping such as the database, queue, validation, and routing components.
    "most important aspect of the  bootstrap process" Service_provider 
    "The application instance is created, the service providers are registered, and the request is handed to the bootstrapped application"

Bootstrapping= 
    the process Laravel takes to combine the necessary bits in the framework together to be able to process and handle the functionality thrown at the system.

deferred_provider=  
    will not be loaded on every request, but only when the services they provide are actually needed.

service_container=
 is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection
    dependency=class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods. //the injector class injects the service=(dependency) to the client=(dependent)


tinker=
to migrate data per terminal and not per manu (useful)
Commands:{
    php artisan tinker
    App\Models\PostsModel::count()
    $post
}

!!!NOTE CONTROLLER AND MODEL NAME SHOULD BE IN PLURAL CAPITALIZE!!! #here you did not use but now you know!! use it!

Middleware= is bridge between a request and a response -> type of filtering mechanism
verifies whether user is authenticated

Closure= is an anonymous function. 
    Closures are often used as callback methods and can be used as a parameter in a function

Controller_Middleware= asiest way of verifying HTTP requests before to the contorller
Middleware can also be assigned to controller’s route or within your controller’s constructor
    <?php
    class UserController extends Controller {
    public function __construct() {
        $this->middleware('auth');
        }
    }?>

GET	/my	index	my.index
GET	/my/create	create	my.create
POST	/my	store	my.store
GET	/my/{my}	show	my.show
GET	/my/{my}/edit	edit	my.edit
PUT/PATCH	/my/{my}	update	my.update
DELETE	/my/{my}	destroy	my.destroy
??????
Response= can be sent from route or from controller

Listeners= handle all the activities mentioned in an event that is being registered. 
    Events provide a simple observer implementation which allows a user to subscribe and listen to various events triggered in the web application
